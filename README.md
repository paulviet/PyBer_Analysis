## **Overview of the PyBer Analysis**

The Purpose of this Analysis is to compare rideshare metrics between city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural locations compare Weekly Fare data for the months of January 2019 to the end of April 2019 (April 29th midnight, actually as it uses week anchoring on Sunday) as well as a summary analysis on the entire data from Jan 1st to May 8th. The analysis will be used to help identify differences that fares affect different city types over the period of 4 months to determine the level of service and fare to charge.

## Ride-Sharing Results

Summary Analysis (Jan 1st - May 8th 2019)

| City Types | Total Rides | Total Drivers | Total Fares | Average Fares per Ride | Average Fare per Driver |
| ---------: | ----------: | ------------: | ----------: | ---------------------: | ----------------------: |
|      Rural |         125 |            78 |   $4,327.93 |                 $34.62 |                  $55.49 |
|   Suburban |         625 |           490 |  $19,356.33 |                 $30.97 |                  $39.50 |
|      Urban |        1625 |          2405 |  $39,854.38 |                 $24.53 |                  $16.57 |

In our analysis of different city types, rural locations had the highest average fare per ride as well as per driver but the lowest total rides, total fares and total number of drivers. One thing to note is that there were 1.5 times as many rides as there were drivers available during this .

Urban locations had the lowest averages for fares per ride and average fares per driver but the most total fares and total rides. A major flag in our data to note is that there were more drivers available than total rides over the span of the time included in the dataset. 

Suburban data showed that the averages were right close to evenly inbetween Rural and Urban rideshare figures.

Looking at the chart above graphing the total sum of Fare earnings by Week for each City Type, the fares for Cities are typically in the range of $2,000-2,500 per driver, while Suburban drivers are earning making approximately $1,000 in fares. Rural drivers are typically earning much less that $500 fares a day. Both Urban and Suburban City Types showed the lowest fares during the first week of January, while Rural type seemed to hover under 500 alternating smaller peaks and dips nearly every other week. However All of the City Types showed a spike on the 3rd weekend of February and and a near equal decline on the first week of March.

  ## Summary

Looking at the sample dataset, it does not describe how efficient we have setup our drivers in locations. A large issue to note is that we have excessive number of Urban drivers that outnumber the Total Rides in that same location. 

Some business recommendations would be to examine other costs factors such as fuel costs (cost per mileage) and drive times (hourly costs of drives). Also geolocation data of more popular pickup and drop off locations. 

Another analysis could be done with redistributing drivers in Urban cities to Suburban and Rural locations to see if an additional influx of drivers has on increasing fare earnings as well as a reduction of drivers in Urban settings effects on fare earnings as well.

And Lastly evaluation of car splitting or passenger capacity should be weighed (multiple pay per occupancy vs single pay for multiple occupancy) to see if how much more fares can be generated by charging for multiple occupancy and multiple destinations.
